Welcome to my 2D Python Orbit Simulator, it is a simple GUI for simulating the orbits of planets around our sun. <br>
<Br>
Users can spawn a preset amount of the planets in our own solar system to observe their orbital behavior, or create a planet <br>
with their own custom mass, velocity, and pixel radius to see what would happen to a planet in our solar system with those conditions. <br>
<br>
GUI also comes with various options for drawing orbit lines, zooming in/out, changing speed of simulation, etc. <br>
<br>
Give it a try yourself by reading the "Getting Started" section

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- Basic [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) usage
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Tkinter GUI Library
  - When installing Python check "tcl/tk and IDLE" under optional features ( Tkinter is packaged with the base Python package on Windows )
  - or in Linux, install via CLI with <br>
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```

1. Clone this Repo <br>
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JustinGnatiuk/OrbitSim.git
    cd OrbitSim
    ```
2. Execute 'run.sh' to start the program <br>
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```
3. Tweak settings and planet parameters, then left click on the canvas anywhere to spawn the planet in that location ( or click the "Spawn Planets" button to generate preset planets based on the real planets in our solar system )
