Welcome to my 2D Python Orbit Simulator, it is a simple GUI for simulating the orbits of planets around our sun. <br>
<Br>
Users can spawn a preset amount of the planets in our own solar system to observe their orbital behavior, or create a planet <br>
with their own custom mass, velocity, and pixel radius to see what would happen to a planet in our solar system with those conditions. <br>
<br>
GUI also comes with various options for drawing orbit lines, zooming in/out, changing speed of simulation, etc. <br>
